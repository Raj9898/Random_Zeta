# Random_Zeta
The goal is to develop numerical methods to verify and extend conjectures about the large values of the Riemann zeta function in short intervals. The detailed objectives are:
1. Learn about the Riemann zeta function and its relation to the distribution of prime numbers.
2. Develop numerical simulations of the Riemann zeta function (referred to as Random Zeta below). Random Zeta is a stochastic process.
3. Analyze the large values of Random Zeta for several interval lengths. In particular, verify the known conjecture for such intervals.
4. Develop numerical simulations for the Riemann zeta function itself.
